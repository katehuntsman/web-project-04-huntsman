    "Analysis: This score is slightly positive but quite close to neutral (0.0). Given the whimsical and playful nature of the song, one might expect a higher score. This suggests that while the lyrics contain positive elements, the sentiment analysis may not fully capture the lighthearted and nostalgic essence of the song.\n",

    "### Hey Jude\n",
    "Polarity Score: 0.132\n",
    "Analysis: This score indicates a moderately positive sentiment. It aligns with the song's themes of encouragement and reassurance. The message of making things better and supporting someone in tough times resonates well with a positive score. However, it might still be lower than expected for such an uplifting anthem, reflecting possible complexities in the lyrics that aren't fully captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Love Story\n",
    "Polarity Score: 0.050\n",
    "Analysis: Similar to \"Birdhouse in Your Soul,\" this score is just above neutral. Given the romantic and hopeful narrative of the song, one would anticipate a more robust positive score. The slight positivity suggests that while the song conveys love and hope, the analysis may miss some of the depth and emotional richness in the lyrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Reflection\n",
    "General Trends: The scores suggest that all three songs are perceived as somewhat positive, but not strongly so. This could indicate that the sentiment analysis tool may struggle with the nuanced emotions present in these lyrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of Sentiment Analysis: The subtlety in lyrical themes, like nostalgia, irony, or complex emotions, might not be well represented by the polarity score. This limitation highlights the challenge of relying solely on automated sentiment analysis for a complete understanding of song lyrics."
